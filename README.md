# Ruby Basics

## Objectives

Review your understanding of 

* defining methods 
* defining methods with default value(s)
* assigning variables
* return values
* string methods


## Instructions

This is a test-driven lab. To get started, (once you fork and clone the lab), run the test suite with the `rspec` command. Read the test output in your terminal to learn how to fill out the methods to get your tests to pass. We've already defined the methods for you––you need to write the code inside of them to give them the desired behavior, as defined by the tests.
